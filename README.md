Today is November 12, 2022 and we spend almost our entire day studying from 9am-3pm with the previous subject and also this one. I'm doing this now as I finish all the task today. I'm proud that I've learned new things today and I'm grateful that I'm able to share ideas with others and also as I gather thoughts from them and specially the interaction with friends. With all honesty i did this code on my own with the help of internet also asking from others but this time i don't copy my classmates work. That's all you deserve a rest jom. Thank you and goodnight!
